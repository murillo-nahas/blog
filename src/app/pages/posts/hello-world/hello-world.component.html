      <p class="mt-4">Hi there! How's going? I hope you're well. Then, allow me to introduce myself, my name is Murillo
        Nahás, 19yo from Brazil, São Paulo. Nowadays I'm working as a fullstack software engineer at a company of my city
        with projects focused in logistics automation.
      </p>
      <p class="text-2xl font-bold mt-9">What about me?</p>
      <p class="mt-4">I've been meaning to create this blog for a while and finally decided to gave the final gas to release it.
        Even being laziness, it only took about a week to create the full scope and a "working" site, not bad, right?
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        Well, let's go. Here I want to show you reader some tech stuff that I know and that I'm learning in this moment, also I want
        to show some personal things that I face in my life. The tech stuff will be associated mainly about Angular, React,
        frontend stuffs and some Haskell content, the functional programming language that I've been enjoying lately.
